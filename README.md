## Features

The portfolio web application includes the following features:

- Responsive and visually appealing user interface designed using Bootstrap, CSS, JSP, and HTML.
- Server-side form validation using Java Bean Validation to prevent users from submitting invalid data, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Client-side form validation using JavaScript to detect and alert users of any incorrect data inputs.
- Custom alert boxes designed using the SweetAlert2 library to display alert or error messages in a visually appealing manner.
- User data from a contact form is stored in a MySQL database using JPA annotations, such as @Entity and @Column.

## Challenges and Learning Opportunities

During the development of this project, I faced some challenges that helped me with valuable learning opportunities and helped me improve my skills.
Initially, I developed the website using Spring MVC and Eclipse's dynamic web project, which involved a lot of configurations such as web.xml and servletdispatcher.xml configuration, as well as database connection configuration in XML files. This process was time-consuming and required a lot of manual configuration. 

To overcome this challenge, I decided to learn more about Spring Boot. At that time I didn't have much prior experience with Spring Boot or the Spring Boot STS, but I was eager to learn. I started from scratch by studying the basic fundamentals of Spring Boot, which helped me to deepen my understanding of how Spring Boot automates the process of developing and configuring a project. This made web app development faster and more time-efficient, and taught me the importance of self-learning.
This experience taught me the importance of self-learning and how to effectively learn new technologies on my own. 

Overall, the challenges I faced during the development of this project helped me grow as a web developer and provided me with valuable learning opportunities that I can use in future projects.

## Conclusion
This portfolio web application is built using modern web technologies and best practices, and demonstrates my skills and expertise in web development. Its features such as responsive design, server-side form validation, and database integration, showcase my ability to build secure, robust, and visually appealing web applications. I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills, and look forward to exploring new technologies and approaches in web development.
